# Lably - Design Documentation 

Lably is a specialized job board for the dental technology industry. It connects dental labs and clinics with pre-verified CAD/CAM specialists, dental technicians, and dental lab professionals.


## What Makes Lably Different?

Unlike general job boards, Lably maintains high quality standards through a rigorous verification process:

- **Verified Candidates Only:** All job seekers must pass interviews and technical assessments before appearing on the platform
- **Live Technical Assessments:** Candidates demonstrate their skills by creating dental work live in front of specialists
- **Industry-Specific:** Focused exclusively on dental technology roles (CAD/CAM, dental technicians, lab technicians)
- **Quality Over Quantity:** Employers access a curated pool of qualified professionals, not hundreds of unvetted applicants

## Target Users

**Job Seekers:**
- Dental technicians
- CAD/CAM specialists  
- Dental lab technicians

**Employers:**
- Dental laboratories
- Dental clinics

**Platform Owner:**
- Manages verification process
- Conducts technical interviews
- Maintains platform quality

## Role System
Three roles cover all essential V1 use cases while keeping auth logic straightforward.
**Separation of Concerns:** Job seekers never see "Post a Job." Employers never see "Apply for Job." This prevents UI clutter and role confusion.
**Security:** Job seekers cannot access employer dashboards. Employers cannot access other employers' applications.
**Admin:** Handles verification interviews, quality control, and moderation. Admin accounts are created manually via database insert to prevent unauthorized privilege escalation.

## Database Design Decisions

**Single users Table:** All users share common fields so one table avoids duplicating auth logic. Role-specific data lives in separate profile tables.
**Separate Profile Tables:** job_seeker_profiles and employer_profiles keep the users table focused on authentication. A shared table would result in many irrelevant NULL columns per user.
**Separate pending_applications Table:** — Verification is a one-time workflow with its own tracking needs (decision notes, file paths, review timestamps). Mixing it into job_seeker_profiles would clutter the public-facing profile table.
**UUIDs over Auto-Increment IDs:** Prevents enumeration attacks where someone could guess valid IDs by incrementing integers (e.g. /users/1, /users/2). Trade-off is slightly more storage and marginally slower indexing, which is acceptable.
**Separate experiences Table:** Job seekers can have 5–10+ experiences, each needing structured data. A separate table makes it easy to add, edit, or delete individual entries. Storing as JSON would make querying and validation significantly harder.
**Activation Tokens in users Table:** Token fields are NULL until needed and cleared after use. A separate tokens table adds complexity with no V1 benefit. Can be refactored in V2 if more token types are needed.

## File Upload Specifications
**Resume:** PDF only, max 2MB. Path: /uploads/resumes/{user_id}.pdf
**Portfolio:** PDF, JPG, or PNG. Max 5MB per file, up to 5 files. Path: /uploads/portfolios/{user_id}_{timestamp}.{ext}. Stored in DB as JSON array of file paths.
